# Multi-Recipient Coin Transfers

## Project Description

A smart contract implementation for the Aptos blockchain that enables efficient batch transfer operations to multiple recipients in a single transaction. This contract allows users to send AptosCoin to multiple addresses simultaneously, reducing transaction costs and improving operational efficiency for businesses, organizations, and individuals who need to make frequent bulk payments.

## Project Vision

To streamline blockchain-based payments by providing a robust, gas-efficient solution for multi-recipient transfers. Our vision is to eliminate the need for multiple individual transactions when distributing funds to multiple parties, making bulk payments as simple as a single function call while maintaining security and transparency on the Aptos blockchain.
